# Status
This project is currently under heavy development and in an **unusable** state. Please check back later if you are a user, or dive in to the [Issues](https://github.com/lylebrown/OpenOrganizer/issues) if you are a developer or other contributor.

# Frameworks
Development is taking place in the latest preview release (as of 7/9/2019) of .NET Core (SDK 3.0.100-preview6-012264). ~~This is to support using [Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor) in our frontend, which will keep as much code as possible in C#.~~ Frontend framework still to be determined, but very small examples of category management are functioning in Razor/Blazor pages.

To utilize these frameworks in the Visual Studio IDE, you must be running the preview version of Visual Studio 2019.
